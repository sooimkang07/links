					<!-- So I wasn't sure how I wanted to format the time yet [especially because my ultimate goal is to have these be live times of different time zones around the world that are currently between midnight and 6 a.m. at the exact moment the user is on the site] so I went on a deep rabbit hole to figure out the most flexible selector for JS that wouldn't have to be something similar to this format (":", "") like we learned in class because maybe later I'd want to add A.M. to some but not others and/or spell some out? I wanted to give myself the flexibility especially with not knowing how the live clocks addition would affect this (if that's even possible for me to execute).  -->
					<!-- So I eventually found this page: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/How_to/Use_data_attributes to figure out to put data-block= in my button element.  -->
					<!-- From my understanding, when the data-block= on each time button is clicked, the JS grabs button.dataset.block and uses that as the key to find the right content and then fills and opens the modal so the logic is tied to the ID, not the specific text -->
					<button class="time" type="button" data-block="0112">01:12</button>
					<button class="time" type="button" data-block="0247">02:47</button>
					<button class="time" type="button" data-block="0305">03:05</button>
